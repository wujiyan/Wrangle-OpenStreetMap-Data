# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data
I choose great Nashville area in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that I care about. Finally, I choose SQL as the data schema to complete the project.
